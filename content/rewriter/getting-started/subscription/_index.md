## Free tier

This plan is automatically granted to you when you sign up for a new account. It allows you to access all GroupDocs.Rewriter Cloud features with with a monthly data processing limit. Free tier allows you to use GroupDocs.Rewriter Cloud API from any number of applications, with a maximum of **150** API calls per month. As long as you stay within the limits, you can also perform concurrent requests.

Apart from the limit on the number of API calls, there are no other restrictions. We do not place watermarks or messages inside rewritten documents or text, and we do not limit the content size processed per request.

The free tier allows you to familiarize yourself with the service, explore its capabilities, and begin the development. However, once you exceed the limits, you must sign up for a paid plan to continue.

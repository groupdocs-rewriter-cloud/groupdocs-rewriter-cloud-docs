**GroupDocs.Rewriter Cloud** is an on-demand service. As such, it has no specific device or operating system requirements and can be used with any programming language that supports HTTPS requests: .NET, Java, PHP, JavaScript (AJAX), Ruby, Python, Kotlin, Go, Node.js, C++, and many more.

You can also use third party REST clients like _cURL_ or _Postman_.

The only requirement is that the device must have access to the Internet and the application must not be blocked by a firewall.

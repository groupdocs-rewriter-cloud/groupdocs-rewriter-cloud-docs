GroupDocs.Rewriter Cloud uses advanced algorithms and natural language processing techniques to rephrase or recreate textual content while preserving its core meaning. This technology is employed to generate alternative versions of text, providing diversity and uniqueness while maintaining relevance and coherence. Applications of rewriting technology range from content creation and paraphrasing to enhancing language variety and style:

- Rewrite texts and documents to convey the original meaning.
- Identify paraphrasing in texts and documents.
- Make textual content shorter and easier to understand while retaining its essential meaning.
- Present key points of content concisely and coherently.
- Substitute words in a given text with synonyms to maintain a comparable meaning while introducing lexical variety.

Supporting [9 languages](/rewriter/supported-languages/), the service can process both text and files in [all popular formats](/rewriter/supported-file-formats/) while maintaining the original layout, structure, and formatting. Documents can also be [converted](/rewriter/supported-file-formats/#conversion) on the fly, ensuring full compatibility with all editors and viewers.

With GroupDocs.Rewriter Cloud, you do not have to worry about complex and resource-intensive machine learning algorithms. Running as an online service, it offers an easy-to-use, fast and secure REST API that allows you to perform the [content processing and conversion](/rewriter/developer-guide/) with a single [HTTPS call](https://api.groupdocs.cloud/v2.0/rewriter/swagger/index.html) from any device or platform, including entry-level smartphones, Chromebooks and legacy PCs.

GroupDocs.Rewriter Cloud also comes with open-source software development kits (SDKs) for [.NET](https://products.groupdocs.cloud/rewriter/net/) and [Python](https://products.groupdocs.cloud/rewriter/python/), which allow you to focus on your business needs rather than low-level technical details of API requests.

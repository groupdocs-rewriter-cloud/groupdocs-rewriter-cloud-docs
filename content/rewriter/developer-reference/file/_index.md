GroupDocs.Rewriter can process any file of supported format in 4 API calls:

1. [Get access token](/rewriter/authorization/)
2. [Upload file](/rewriter/file/upload/)
3. [Send files for processing](/rewriter/file/request/)
4. [Fetch results](/rewriter/file/fetch/)

Because GroupDocs.Rewriter Cloud is provided as a REST API, file processing can be performed on any platform with Internet access.

We also provide open-source SDKs for a number of popular programming languages, that wrap all routine operations into a few native methods. It makes interaction with GroupDocs.Translation Cloud services much easier, allowing you to focus on the task at hand rather than technical details.
